## **⚙️ How It Works**
### **🧠 GPT-2 Generates Core Apology**
The AI **only generates a short, structured apology fragment** (e.g., `"I sincerely apologize for missing such an important date."`).  
👉 **No more AI rambling!**

### **📜 Smart Apology Formatting**
The output is then **wrapped in one of several predefined apology templates** for consistency.

### **🤖 Auto-Detects Who’s Affected**
The AI tries to **infer who you should be apologizing to** based on the blunder.  
For example:
| Keyword        | Apology Addressed To |
|---------------|--------------------|
| "mom"        | Mom |
| "friend"      | Bestie |
| "boss"        | Boss |
| "roommate"    | Roommate |
